zTSOHELP is an ISPF dialog that makes access to, and use of, TSO Help
much easier.

To install copy the ZTSOHELP member into a library in your SYSEXEC or
SYSPROC allocations. More below on installation and customization.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Included with the ZTSOHELP package is member REXX, which is a TSO HELP
member created by Bruce Koss, and packaged for TSO Help by John
Kalinich, to provide help on various REXX functions and features.

Then copy the member REXX into your HELP library (e.g. SYS1.HELP or
your installation version of SYS1.HELP).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name:        zTSOHELP

  Function:    Present the user with a table of available
               TSO HELP pages from which the user may select
               to browse.

  Syntax:      %zTSOHELP help-command  /w  /t

               help-command is optional and will position the
               list at that command (or close to it)

               /t will include notelines for imbeds

               /w will generate a warning message for any
               help entries that do not exist and thus were
               not added to the table

  Commands:    Locate cmd next
               Only string
               Refresh
               RL    (repeat locate)
               S command
               SEt
               Sort column order
               History - display change history

  Notes:       The Description field is scrollable when the cursor
               is in the field. This is to support descriptions
               greater than 53 characters if they exist.

  Command Table:   It is recommended that an ISPF Command Table
                   entry be created to make it faster to get to
                   this application. This is a sample:

                   Verb    TSOH
                   Trunc:  0
                   Action: SELECT CMD(%ZTSOHELP &ZPARM) NEWAPPL(ISR)
                   Desc:   TSO Help ISPF Application

  Dependency: Optional the HELP Data member to be created
               using the sample data provided (find *custom*)

               FSHelp (CBT Tape File 134) may be used (see *custom*)
